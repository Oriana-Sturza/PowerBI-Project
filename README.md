PROJECT OVERVIEW:

Based on my project findings, I conducted a detailed survey using Power BI Desktop to analyze the data professional landscape. The survey encompassed participants from various countries, including Canada, India, the United Kingdom, and the United States, among others.

Summary of Findings

Country of Survey Takers:
The survey included a diverse group of participants from multiple countries, ensuring a wide range of perspectives.

Average Salary by Job Title:
The data revealed significant variations in average salaries across different job titles. Data Scientists, Data Engineers, Data Architects, Data Analysts, Database Developers, and students/individuals seeking employment all reported different salary ranges, reflecting their varying levels of experience and job demands.

Demographics:
The average age of survey respondents was approximately 29.87 years.

Work/Life Balance and Job Satisfaction:
Participants rated their happiness with their work/life balance, with an average satisfaction score of 5.74 out of 10.
Similarly, happiness with salary was measured, with an average score of 4.27 out of 10.

Favorite Programming Languages:
The most favored programming languages among data professionals were Python, R, C/C++, JavaScript, and Java, with Python being the most popular.

Difficulty in Breaking into the Data Field:
The survey highlighted the perceived difficulty in entering the data profession. 42.7% of participants found it neither easy nor difficult, while 24.76% found it difficult, and 21.27% found it easy. A smaller percentage found it very difficult or very easy.

Problem-Solving Approach

To address the challenges identified in the survey, I employed a systematic problem-solving approach:

Data Collection and Cleaning:
I started by collecting survey data from a wide demographic to ensure diversity in responses. I then cleaned the data to remove any inconsistencies or errors, ensuring accuracy in analysis.

Data Analysis with Power BI:
Utilizing Power BI Desktop, I performed detailed data analysis. This involved creating visualizations to easily interpret the data, such as bar charts for salary comparisons and pie charts for programming language popularity.

Identifying Key Insights:
Through the visualizations, I identified key insights regarding job satisfaction, salary expectations, and the challenges faced by data professionals. This helped in understanding the current landscape and the needs of data professionals.
